# Web-Portal-for-EEGAI-NGO-
My project focuses on developing a web portal for EEGAI, a youth-led non-profit organization. The main objective of this project is to effectively manage and coordinate various actors within the organization, including volunteers, donors, and staff members. Additionally, the portal will handle donations, projects, and events.
